Configuring Project Settings

It is recommended to use Linear color space (Edit > Project Settings > Player > Other Settings).

Specific settings files are provided in the folder "Unity Project Settings".
Each file overrides the project’s settings in the corresponding section.


Project Settings - Input (Required)

  Horizontal and vertical for better handling. Also camera movement using the keypad when enabled.


Project Settings - Physics

  Recommended project settings. Note that importing this file overrides your project’s Layer Collision Matrix.
